# MapBox RubyMotion Example

This is an example showing usage of the [MapBox iOS SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk).

The code was ported to Ruby from the [MapBox iOS Example](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-example).

### Build Instructions

 1. Clone `git://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-example.git` one level up.
    This repository does not include various resources (icons, map tiles,
    etc.) included with the official MapBox iOS Example, as their licensing is
    unclear. Rather, they will be copied from this repo on build.
 2. `rake` to build.
